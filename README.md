# Java Test Project (JTP)

In this repository are a lot of tutorials, mostly for JavaFX. Many are something that I
wanted but didn't know how to do it. So in order to remember them, I am having them here.

Many of the JavaFX tutorials will be mostly custom ui components. Sometimes for these
tutorials, I use Perplexity because I do not know how to do it.

The tutorials here are not blindly written. I understand the code before I use it anywhere.
